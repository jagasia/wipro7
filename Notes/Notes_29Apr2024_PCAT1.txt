1) Cloud lab credentials	(received)
2) Git lab credentials 		(not yet received)
--------------------------------------
How to use cloud lab?
1) open a browser in your computer, and navigate to:-
	https://cloud2.rpsconsulting.in/console/#/
2) username and password are provided to you in email. 

You are the Administrator for this cloud lab.
	c:\users\Administrator
		create a folder "training"
	
inside "training" folder
	create "Assignments" folder
		"PCAT" folder
		"Java" folder


c:\users\Administrator\training
	this folder may contain many things. but you do not want to push everything to gitlab.

c:\users\Administrator\training\Assignments
	this folder only we are going to sync with gitlab repository.

--------------------------------
Graph
	is a datastructure that maintains the vertices and edges
	so that, we can find the shortest distance between vertices based on the available edges.
	

india is our country
count of each letter in this statement:

i	3
n	2
d	1
a	1
 	3
s	1
o	2
u	2
r	2
c	1



what is the type of variable, you can have to hold the result for above 
	Map	
		HashMap
		Hashtable
		TreeMap
	correct answer is LinkedHashMap	(see the result, the letters are in the order of their appearance)

Choosing the correct datastructure will solve half of the problem


Hashtable
--------------
	2 dimensional data structure
	that can contain	key-value pairs

We have discussed hashing.
	hashing is a function that translates key to offset
	offset is the relative location to find an element

arr[5]	move 5 units from the first element
arr[0]	move 0 units from the first element	(means you dont need to move. you are already in first element)

this is all about offset. Relative position

key => offset		(hashing)

why we need to find offset?
	to position the element in that location (or)
	to find an element which is already stored in that position



Hashtable is the datastructure that uses the hashing function to find location where to store an element
and later uses the same hashing function to locate the element.



class Entry<K,V>
{
	K key;
	V value;
}

class Hashtable<K,V>
{
	Set<Entry> entries;	
}


if you create a hash table class by yourself, what are the methods you will provide?
	allow users to add an entry:
		put(k,v);
	allow users to find a value based on key:
		get(k)	return v
	allow users to get all the keys as a set
		keySet()	returns all keys as a Set
	allow users to get all the values as a Collection
		values()

	the key is a Set.	What is Set?	Set is a collection of distinct objects.

	ht.put(1,"Japan");
	ht.put(1,"China");	China will replace Japan
		

Activity:
1) move your assignments to cloud lab (understand the folder structure)
2) Understand the Hashtable datastructure
