1) Cloud lab credentials	(received)
2) Git lab credentials 		(not yet received)
--------------------------------------
How to use cloud lab?
1) open a browser in your computer, and navigate to:-
	https://cloud2.rpsconsulting.in/console/#/
2) username and password are provided to you in email. 

You are the Administrator for this cloud lab.
	c:\users\Administrator
		create a folder "training"
	
inside "training" folder
	create "Assignments" folder
		"PCAT" folder
		"Java" folder


c:\users\Administrator\training
	this folder may contain many things. but you do not want to push everything to gitlab.

c:\users\Administrator\training\Assignments
	this folder only we are going to sync with gitlab repository.

--------------------------------
Graph
	is a datastructure that maintains the vertices and edges
	so that, we can find the shortest distance between vertices based on the available edges.
	

india is our country
count of each letter in this statement:

i	3
n	2
d	1
a	1
 	3
s	1
o	2
u	2
r	2
c	1



what is the type of variable, you can have to hold the result for above 
	Map	
		HashMap
		Hashtable
		TreeMap
	correct answer is LinkedHashMap	(see the result, the letters are in the order of their appearance)

Choosing the correct datastructure will solve half of the problem


Hashtable
--------------
	2 dimensional data structure
	that can contain	key-value pairs

We have discussed hashing.
	hashing is a function that translates key to offset
	offset is the relative location to find an element

arr[5]	move 5 units from the first element
arr[0]	move 0 units from the first element	(means you dont need to move. you are already in first element)

this is all about offset. Relative position

key => offset		(hashing)

why we need to find offset?
	to position the element in that location (or)
	to find an element which is already stored in that position



Hashtable is the datastructure that uses the hashing function to find location where to store an element
and later uses the same hashing function to locate the element.



class Entry<K,V>
{
	K key;
	V value;
}

class Hashtable<K,V>
{
	Set<Entry> entries;	
}


if you create a hash table class by yourself, what are the methods you will provide?
	allow users to add an entry:
		put(k,v);
	allow users to find a value based on key:
		get(k)	return v
	allow users to get all the keys as a set
		keySet()	returns all keys as a Set
	allow users to get all the values as a Collection
		values()

	the key is a Set.	What is Set?	Set is a collection of distinct objects.

	ht.put(1,"Japan");
	ht.put(1,"China");	China will replace Japan
		

Activity:
1) move your assignments to cloud lab (understand the folder structure)
2) Understand the Hashtable datastructure



While hashing,
	you get a value based on key

if that value (location) if already is occupied by another key,

means, 2 keys have same hashvalue (this is called collision)
	i) re hashing
		the hashvalue mod 4 (for ex)




truncation
mid square
modulo
division
-----------------
Merge sort
Quick sort
Heap sort


Merge sort
--------------
	divide and conquer approach
	divide the large list into sub lists and sort them and then merge them

Quick sort
-------------
	Pivot
	choose an element in the list as a pivot
		how to choose pivot??????
			if you choose an element as pivot, then it should be in such a way that
				all elements left side of pivot must be smaller than the pivot
				all elements right side of pivot must be greater than the pivot

	78,67,45,90,96,120,110,100,97

can you choose an element as pivot???????
		96 is the pivot because, 	all elements left of 96 are smaller than 96
					all elements right of 96 are greater than 96

78,67,45,90		sort this smaller list		45,67,78,90
96
120,110,100,97		sort this smaller list		97,100,110,120


45,67,78,90,96,97,100,110,120
	it is sorted now

in the above example, naturally, it happened to be smaller in left of 96 and greater in right of 96

But we cannot expect this everytime.

so, we can choose any pivot and move the smaller elements to left of pivot
and move greater elements of pivot to right


21,52,3,42,5,26,97,82,9,10

21,3,5,26,9,10
42
52,97,82


3,5,9,10,21,26
42
52,82,97

--------------------------------------
Heap sort
------------

4, 10, 3, 5, 1

		4
	3		10
          1		         5



1,3,4,5,10


Binary search tree:
-----------------------
	every root node can have left or right or both
		left is always smaller than root and 
		right is always greater than root


if you add the following numbers to a binary search tree

	1
		2
			3
				4
					5
						6


this is similar to a linear data structure (linkedlist)
the advantage of binary search tree is missing in this way.

rotate the tree in such a way, the height of the tree is minimum as possible.

n nodes in a tree, the height of the tree can be maximum how much

Assignments totally 5		(day 1: 1,2,3 and remaining 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
update in chat, once, 4 / 5 assignments completed
--------------------------------------------

Your assignment files must be present inside your assignments folder.


WORD (MS Office) is not installed in cloud lab

take images from your doc and save them as separate jpg file
and explanation as separate txt file
----------------------------------------------------
After lunch, I will give you steps to follow for GIT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

GitLab credentials are shared to you in email:
	http://10.10.16.125:8929

username:	abcdefg
email:	abcdefg@rpsconsulting.in
password:	<<password>>





	

http://10.10.16.125:8929
	this GitLab URL works ONLY in the cloud lab.
	it will not work in your local system

only in cloud lab, you can open a browser and type:
	http://10.10.16.125:8929

--------------------------
All of you (in cloud lab), Open a browser and enter the gitlab URL
	login using GIT credentials and
		change the password


-------------------------
GIT LAB STEPS:
----------------------
1) in cloud lab (only) these steps to be done.
2) in cloud lab, open a browser and login to 
	http://10.10.16.125:8929
		the credentials are given to you by email
		use the same username b7userXX
		enter the password you created recently
----------------You have now logged into official GIT LAB------------------
1) create a project
	i) create blank project
		name: assignment_jag
		project url:		http://10.10.16.125:8929/b7user01/		assignment_jag


	ii) Visibility level
		Public

	iii) Project configuration
		UNTICK 	"initialize repository with README

-----------------------------
Now that we have created a project in git lab,
	this project will be the remote repository for our assignments folder


in cmd:	c:\users\administrator\training\assignments

git init
git remote add origin http://10.10.16.125:8929/b76userXX/assignment_YOURNAME.git
git add .
git commit -m "first"
git push origin master


when you push it will ask you
	username:	b76userXX
	password:	<< remember it will not show anything while you type. so if you type and user delete backspace >>

enter password clearly.
you have already changed your password. that password

FIRST TIME :-

git config --global user.name <<username>>
git config --global user.email <<email>>

git init
git remote add origin http://10.10.16.125:8929/<<username>>/<<projectname>>.git
git add .
git commit -m "first"
git push origin master

-----------------
Whenever you do some changes or you add files/ folders into assignment, you want to push these changes to gitlab.
you do ONLY the following henceforth:-

git add .
git commit -m "29Apr 15:21"
git push origin master

-----------------------------------------

Can any one explain the compilation process of Java (how it differs from c/ c++)
	the compilation process in java is different from c and c++

in java, the compilation happens in 2 stages.

in c or c++, the source code is compiled to get machine language code.
the machine language itself is different from processors to processors. OS is also 16 bit 32 bit 64 bit like lot of differences.

if i compile a c program in a 32 bit machine, then i cannot run it in 64 bit machine
also, c language itself slightly different in different platform

Turbo C
	conio.h	
this library is not found in gcc 


Java runs in 
	Linux
	MacOs
	Windows

platform independent


in  case of Java,
	java compiler DOES NOT translate java code into machine language code.
	java compiler translates java code into byte code. (this byte code cannot run in any platform directly)

	java virtual machine (contain java runtime environment)
	jre when it executes byte code, it FURTHER translates byte code into machine code
		this is done by JIT compiler

Just In Time compiler

JDK vs JRE

JDK 
	is for developers
	is to compile and execute
JRE
	is to run (execute)
	does not have a compiler

--------------------------------------------------
Final activity for PCAT:
All 5 assignments must be in cloud lab.
All of them are pushed to git lab.
