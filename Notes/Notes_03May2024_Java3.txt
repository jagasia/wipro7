Day #6
Java day #3
----------------
String class
StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes

Task:
-------
I need your suggestions/algorithms to solve the below problem.
	
Input:
	You are selected for the interview, to know more about the details, you may call 9898989898 or write us at abcd@efgh.com

Output:
	9898989898
	abcd@efgh.com

How do you extract only the  phone numbers and email addresses in the message.

Task:
-------
Accept an email  address from the user and check if it is a valid email address or not as per the format.


The above 2 tasks can be simplified by using 
	Regular Expressions


Regular expression symbols:
	a pattern in regex will have the <<symbol>><<multiplicity>>

	if you do not mention the multiplicity then it will be considered as 1

	.	(dot symbol)		means anything	it can be character, symbol, number, space or anything
	\d	in java, you have to use \\ for one \
		\d means digit		0-9 is the possible value
	\D	non digit
	
	[]	square brackets are used to specify the list of characters and range from which 1 character can appear
	()	normal brackets are used to group a pattern and specify mulitplicity and also use | OR operator
	
multiplicity
	+	one or more
	*	zero or more
	?	optional	but 	0 or 1
multiplicity can also be mentioned using
	{1}	only once
	{3}	3 times		3 and only 3 times
	{1,3}	1 to 3 times	min 1 and max 3
	{1,}	atleast once	max? any		similar to + symbol
	{,3}	maximum 3	min? any

ex:
	\\d{3}		means 3 digits
	[0-9]{3}		means 3 digits
	[a-z]{1,5}		minimum 1 and maximum 5 lower case alphabet
	[0-9A-Za-z]	number or lower or upper case character
	[aeiou]		any 1 vowel is allowed
	[aeiou]{3}		3 vowels allowed
	[.]		usually . is a symbol that means anything. But inside the [] a . means a character called .

	|		OR operator

String class provides a method to check if the string itself matches a pattern or not
	String str="9898989898";
	str.matches("\\d{10}");		//returns true


checking if the string matches a pattern or not
		str.matches()

but how do you extract the portions of the string that matches a pattern?

Ex:
extract all the mobile numbers in a string message.

download the word document from
	https://github.com/jagasia/wipro2/blob/jag/Java/Java_Mock_11%20(2).docx

and do the regex challenge (requirement 3)

Requirement 3:
   In this requirement, you need to validate the website and the mobile number of the note.

a)Create a Class Main with the following static methods:
Method Website	Description
static Boolean validateWebsite(String website)	Validate the website based on the rules given below. Returns true ifwebsite is valid else return false
static Boolean validateMobile(String mobileNo)	Validate the mobile number based on the rules given below. Returnstrue if mobileNo is valid else returnfalse

b) While validating website follow the below rules,
   
http://www.iit.edu.in
iit - domain name
edu - sTLD
in - ccTLD

1. The website should start http:// or https:// protocol
2. The website may or may not contain " www." after the protocol.
3. The domain name should contain only alphabets, either uppercase or lowercase and should not contain any special characters.
4. sTLD (sponsored top-level domain) should contain 2 to 6 characters
5. ccTLD(country code top-level domain) may or may not be present in a website and it should contain 2 to 6 characters

c) While validating mobile number follow the below rules,

1.The mobile number should have prefix as " +91 "(international calling code).
2.The mobile number should have 10 numbers [0-9].

Note: Print "Website is valid" if website is valid else print "Website is invalid". Print "Mobile number is valid" if mobile number is valid else print "Mobile number is invalid".
            All the above print statements are present in the main method.


-----------------------------
OOP
	Object Oriented Programming

Object
	is the instance of a class.

You need to create a class that defines the objects's
	properties 
	methods

algorithms = method
datastructures = properties

data and logic

A class wraps these algo & ds in a box.

When, How, Why, Where
	to create a class

A class can be created for a Program to run.
	without a class, a program cannot run.
	because, main method itself is part of a class

public class Shivam
{
	//i see 0 constructors here. in my source code, there is no constructor. 
	//during compilation, the compiler creates a default constructor.
	//a default constructor do not have any argument	0-arg cons
	
	public Shivam(int i)
	{}
	//now, in my source code, i see 1 constructor with argument
	//lets compile
	//now, compiler understands that you created a constructor, so compiler does not create any cons
}


A class can be created as an user defined Type
	composite type

	if i want to store a number in a variable,
		int
		byte
		short
		long
	if i want to store a sentence in a variable
		StringBuilder
		String
		StringBuffer
	if i want to store today's date
		java.util.Date
		java.sql.Date
		java.time.LocalDate
	if i want to store information about an Employee??????
		there is no pre defined type for that
		so i will create a class Employee and
		then create objects of Employee class

Guidelines for creating a class:
	1) naming convention for class
		it should be a noun
		starts in capital letter and follows PascalCase
		public class must be stored in the separte file whose name is same as class name
		private class can be part of another class. This is called as inner class

	2) a class can contain data members which must be non-public
		private data members are good
		protected, default also fine.	But
		public is not good.		But in some exam system, they may use public for convenience.

	3) private / non public data members shall be allowed to access using public
		getters
		setters

	ex:
		public class  Employee
		{
			private int id;

			public void setId(int id)	
			{
				this.id=id;
			}
			public int getId()
			{
				return id;
			}
		}


	4) a class will always have a default constructor (created by compiler) when we do not create any constructor.
		if you create a constructor with argument, then kindly create a constructor without argument also.

		what is a constructor?
			a constructor is used to create and object of a class
		

	5) toString() method
		Object class has toString() method.
		Any class I create will  have super class Object
		so, toString is also available for my Employee class also

		the default behavior of Object class toString must be overridden in our class

	6) if you create 2 employees and want to check if they are equal or not
		Employee e1=new Employee();
		e1.setId(20);

		Employee e2=new Employee();
		e2.setId(20);

		System.out.println(e1.equals(e2));		//what is this?

		equals method is defined in Object class
		so, we can use this method in any object
		
		Override the equals method so that, you define the logic to determine, if 2 objects are equal or not


1) class must have private data members
2) constructor without argument, when you create constructor with argument
3) public getters and setters for accessing private data members
4) toString method to display content of the object of this class
5) equals method to compare 2 objects of this class
