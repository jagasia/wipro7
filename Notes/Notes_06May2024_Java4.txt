Exception Handling
--------------------------
What is exception?
	you think exception is error?
	logical error?
	Exception vs exemption
	NO.

Exception is not error. it is not logical error.
Exception is any abnormal event that might occur during the execution of the program.
	
	
If you create a method and somebody else is going to call the method.

A is creating a method.		
B is calling the method.


A understands that the denominator cannot be 8. If it is 8, what to do? 
A, cannot decide that. So A will throw exception.

B will call the method and gets exception. 
B is allowed to  handle the exception.

class Employee
{
	int id;		//cannot be negative
	String name;	//atleast 1 character and no numbers
	Date dateOfBirth;	//cannot be future date
	double salary;	//cannot be negative
}

Exceptions are significant, because, if the exception is not handled, the program terminates abruptly.

Java language has lot of pre defined exception classes. 

Object
	Throwable
		Error
		Exception


Error
	we cannot handle Errors. they are always unhandled
	program have to terminate when error occurs.

Exception
	is the super class for all exception classes like
		RuntimeException
		ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
		NullPointerException
		InvalidCastException
		IOException
		ArithmeticException
		InputMismatchException
		NumberFormatException
		ClassNotFoundException
		InterruptedException


These classes are defined
	all these classes are derived from Exception class




public class ArithmeticException extends RuntimeException
public class IOException extends Exception 


A class that is derived from Exception
	is a checked Exception

A class that is derived from RuntimeException
	is an unchecked Exception

What are checked exceptions?
	are checked by the compiler.
	are very serious, that the method that throws these exceptions, must 
		i) handle the exception
		ii) declare that these are thrown

1) try-catch-finally		blocks are used to handle the exceptions
2) throws			clause is used to declare that the method throws these exceptions

Any class derived from Exception or its sub class (other than RuntimeException) are checked exceptions




public class Bank {
	
	public void withdraw(int amount) throws Exception
	{
		if(amount>30000)
		{
			//we create this code. we know that amount >30k is invalid
			//but in that case, what to do? is not our role.
			throw new Exception("amount is invalid");
		}
	}
}

in above code, we throw a checked exception so compiler does not compile our code, untile we
	handle it (or)
	declare with throws
-------------------------------


public class Bank {
	
	public void withdraw(int amount)   
	{
		if(amount>30000)
		{
			//we create this code. we know that amount >30k is invalid
			//but in that case, what to do? is not our role.
			throw new NumberFormatException("amount is invalid");
		}else
		{
			System.out.println("Remember to collect the cash");
		}
	}
}



public class App {

	public static void main(String[] args){
		Bank bank=new Bank();
		bank.withdraw(31000);
		System.out.println("Continues");
	}

}



Above code
	NumberFormatException is sub class of RuntimeException hence
	it is unchecked by the compiler
	we may handle or continue to run without handling exception


Finally
	block is at the end of try/ catch
	there can be try-finally		without any catch
	try can be followed by catch/ finally or catch finally
	finally is executed even if exception occurred or not, handled or not, once try is executed, finally is executed at the end


Activity:
------------
learn to throw exceptions
	checked
	unchecked
	throws to declare checked exceptions
	handle exceptions using
		try-catch-finally
		nested try	and also write throw inside catch		re-throw
	create user defined exceptions of types 	checked and unchecked exceptions

-----------------------------------------------------
Collections:
------------------
Can you list the limitations of arrays?
-------------------------------------------------
	fixed length
	contigeous memory locations


Array and ArrayList
ArrayList alist	=>		ArrayList<Object> alist;

You need to know the length  of array to create. this is very big drawback.





public class App2 {

	private static int[] findPrimeInRange(int start, int end)
	{
		int arr[]=new int[Integer.MAX_VALUE];
		//write your code here. We can store only 100 numbers  in arr. But we do not know how many prime
		//numbers are available between start and end
		return arr;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}





------------------
int arr[]=new int[10];
ArrayList<int>				//NOT POSSIBLE
ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>();		//POSSIBLE

--------------------
Arrays can contain elements of primitive type also.
Collection cannot have primitive types but we can use wrapper classes if required.
Java collections
	java.util package
provides

List and Set type of collections

List and Set are interfaces,
	which are implemented by lot of classes

List
	ArrayList		(modern)
	LinkedList		(modern)
	Vector	(legacy)
	Stack	(legacy)


Set
	HashSet
	TreeSet
	LinkedHashSet

the above are collection classes

Map	is an application of collection
	HashMap
	Hashtable
	TreeMap
	LinkedHashMap


List
	allows duplicates
	allows any number of null 
	maintains the elements in the same order of addition
	allows sorting the elements using
		Collections.sort method
	ListIterator is supported by List category classes only. ListIterator can traverse in both directions
	provides index to access any element directly using  index	

Set
	the order of elements in a set is based on the type of the set
	rejects duplicates.		
	1 null is allowed. another null is considered as duplicate
	does not allow us to sort later	(later means, after adding elements)
		cannot use Collections.sort method on set
	supports only Iterator and not ListIterator and hence, we can traverse in forward direction only
	no index and hence, we cannot access any element directly. But use to traverse from left to right and find

	HashSet		order of the elements is based on the hashCode method
	TreeSet		order of the elements is sorted based on Comparable/Comparator
	LinkedHashSet	order of the elements is same as the insertion order

--------------------------------------------
List
	List<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>();

	we can pass this object to argument of type List<Integer>

		public void method1(List<Integer> x)

			method1(new ArrayList<>());
			method1(new LinkedList<>());

	
Set
	Set<String> x=new HashSet<>();


ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>();

find the methods in Collection
mostly those methods found in list and set
but
	get(index)		is only related to list



import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class App4 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		List<String> countries=new ArrayList<>();
		countries.add("India");
		countries.add("Afganisthan");
		countries.add("Japan");
		countries.add("Zimbabwe");
		countries.add("Bhutan");
		countries.add("China");
		countries.add("Australia");
		
		//how to sort these countries?
		Collections.sort(countries);
		
		System.out.println(countries);
	}

}

[Afganisthan, Australia, Bhutan, China, India, Japan, Zimbabwe]
----------------------------------List of user defined types----------------------

public class Employee {
	private Integer id;
	private String name;
	private String department;
	private Integer salary;
	
	public Employee() {}

	public Employee(Integer id, String name, String department, Integer salary) {
		super();
		this.id = id;
		this.name = name;
		this.department = department;
		this.salary = salary;
	}

	public Integer getId() {
		return id;
	}

	public void setId(Integer id) {
		this.id = id;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public String getDepartment() {
		return department;
	}

	public void setDepartment(String department) {
		this.department = department;
	}

	public Integer getSalary() {
		return salary;
	}

	public void setSalary(Integer salary) {
		this.salary = salary;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Employee [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", department=" + department + ", salary=" + salary + "]";
	}
	
}




import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class App_Employee {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		List<Employee> employees=new ArrayList<>();
		employees.add(new Employee(12, "Alex", "ECE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(10, "John", "EEE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(11, "Zaheer", "ECE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(22, "Babu", "EEE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(18, "Kumar", "ECE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(15, "Chandru", "ECE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(16, "Muruga", "CSE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(14, "Prasad", "ECE", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(21, "Sathish", "Mech", 100000));
		employees.add(new Employee(13, "Dinesh", "IT", 100000));
		
		
		
	}

}


how can we display all elements of a List?
	1) for loop
	2) for each loop
	3) iterator
	4) list iterator (for lists)

1) for loop

		for(int i=0;i<employees.size();i++)
		{
			System.out.println(employees.get(i));
		}

2) for each loop
		for(Employee e:employees)
		{
			System.out.println(e);
		}

3) iterator
		Iterator<Employee> it = employees.iterator();
		while(it.hasNext())
		{
			Employee e = it.next();
			System.out.println(e);
		}

--------------------
Iterator
	hasNext()		boolean
	next()		Object
	remove()		removes the current element  of the iteration

ListIterator
	works only with List category (not Set categotry)
	hasNext()
	next()
	remove()
	hasPrevious()
	previous()


the proper way to remove an element of the list WHILE iterating the list:

		Iterator<Employee> it = employees.iterator();
		while(it.hasNext())
		{
			Employee e = it.next();
			if(e.getId().equals(22))
			{
				it.remove();
			}			
		}


inside a for-each loop, you cannot remove an element
----------------------
		for(Employee e:employees)
		{
			if(e.getId().equals(22))
			{
				employees.remove(e);	 //ERROR java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
			}
			System.out.println(e);
		}





Employee [id=12, name=Alex, department=ECE, salary=100000]
Employee [id=10, name=John, department=EEE, salary=100000]
Employee [id=11, name=Zaheer, department=ECE, salary=100000]
Employee [id=22, name=Babu, department=EEE, salary=100000]
Exception in thread "main" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
	at java.base/java.util.ArrayList$Itr.checkForComodification(ArrayList.java:1013)
	at java.base/java.util.ArrayList$Itr.next(ArrayList.java:967)
	at App_Employee.main(App_Employee.java:21)


----------------
		ListIterator<Employee> it=employees.listIterator(employees.size());
		while(it.hasPrevious())
		{
			Employee e = it.previous();
			System.out.println(e);
		}
